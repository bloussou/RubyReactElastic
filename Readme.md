# The project
This project is about visualize the result to an elasticsearch cloud into a react app with a D3.js chart. In order to do that I have used a ruby API.

# How to use it
In each folder you will find a readme wich will help you to clone and install the app. Don't forget to set up the url in the ruby controller.

# Dependencies
* React
* Rails
* D3 js
* elasticsearch for rails
